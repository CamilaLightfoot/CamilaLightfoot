# Hi, I'm Camila Lightfoot 👋

I'm a **Computer Science student at George Mason University** and an **AI Fellow at Break Through Tech** in partnership.  
I’m passionate about applying **Machine Learning** to real-world problems, from sentiment analysis to image classification, with a strong foundation in **Python, scikit-learn, and data-driven storytelling**.  
I care deeply about **ethical AI** and building technology that is inclusive, impactful, and accessible.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### [Lab 2 – Data Preparation for Modeling](https://github.com/CamilaLightfoot/ML-Life-Cycle-Data-Understanding-and-Data-Preparation)
Preprocessed Airbnb data, handled missing values, transformed categorical and numerical variables, and identified relevant features for modeling.  
**Skills:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, Pandas, NumPy  

### [Lab 3 – Train Decision Trees & K-Nearest Neighbors](#)
Trained and evaluated classification models using Decision Trees and KNN, compared performance, and tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy.  
**Skills:** scikit-learn, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation  

### [Lab 5 – Machine Learning Life Cycle: Evaluation and Deployment](#)
Performed feature selection, evaluated the model with accuracy and confusion matrix, and discussed considerations for deployment in production.  
**Skills:** Feature selection, evaluation metrics, deployment considerations  

### [eCornell ML Portfolio](https://github.com/CamilaLightfoot/My-eCornell-Portfolio-ML-lifecycle-projects)
A collection of projects covering the full ML lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model deployment.
